SIMIL -- Issue Log
-----------------------------------------
=================Bugs====================
-----------------------------------------
- Min and max restrictions on Date of Birth in signup form.	
- Adding interests, check to see if already belong to the user.
	- Unless we only show interests to which the user doesn't yet belong.
	- For now, we override any preexisting interests.
- Similar stuff needs to be done for all database inserts.
	- Check for member panels etc.
- Location is currently hardcoded, as it's a required foreign key
- empty interests or panels causes errors in personal page query

================Issues===================
-----------------------------------------
- Need to move from client-side to server-side or ajax form validation (required fields)
- Validate user is not already logged in before visiting the signup page.
